abstract = {Computer science education continues to grow in importance as the technology industry becomes increasingly prevalent on a global scale.  In order to remain competitive, computer science education must continue to increase both the quality and quantity of graduates.  In efforts to achieve such ends, the Wags system has been designed and developed to be used in conjunction with the Microlab Learning Cycle, an educational process founded in constructivist learning theory.  Through continual testing and refinement, the Microlab Learning Cycle and accompanying system have been able to produce measurable improvements in student understanding and retention of important computer science concepts, while providing an active-learning classroom environment that students enjoy and find valuable.},
